Project Description -----------------------------------
For the coursework project of WAD in the diploma year, an employee
management web application was built with a React frontend and a
Laravel Backend. For this module we implemented the same backend 
with Java SpringBoot under the MVC architecture. Actually we followed 
Models, DAOs (Data Access Object) and Controllers in this project.

The whole project is managed with Github and all commits are pushed 
in to the repos by sending pull request good practices and we 
published the code as open source.
